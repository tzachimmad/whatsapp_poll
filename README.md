# whatsapp_poll
Updates a google sheet with poll information taken from whatsapp group conversation.
Currently u need to have installed google python client library and given neccessary permissions for the python application
and relative google drive account. Missing from the repo is the client_secret.json file which can be obtained via the instructions in the attached link.

More information on google client api and setup could be found here: https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/quickstart/python

Notice that Im using version 2 of Google's api while latest version is version 3.
Another important issue is that this app is targeted towards conversations in hebrew.
